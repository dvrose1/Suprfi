# **SuprFi Product Strategy 2.0**

## **Tech-Enabled Direct Lending for Home Services**

*November 2025*

## **Executive Summary**

SuprFi will pivot to be a direct-to-consumer specialty lender focused exclusively on home services repairs and improvements. We will build a technology-enabled lending business that originates, underwrites, and services loans directly to homeowners, using a preferred contractor network for customer acquisition and fulfillment.

**Key Strategic Elements:**

1\.    	**Direct Lending Model**: We own the customer relationship and control the entire lending process, avoiding commoditization of embedded lending

2\.    	**CRM Integration as Distribution**: While maintaining our direct model, we’ll integrate with major CRMs (FieldRoutes, Jobber, ServiceTitan) to reduce friction for contractors and access customer flow \- but as a channel, not our identity

3\.    	**Data as Competitive Moat**: By combining direct lending data with CRM integration insights, we’ll build the most comprehensive dataset on home services financing, enabling superior underwriting, new revenue streams, and long-term defensibility

4\.    	**Path to Profitability**: Clear trajectory to $50-100M revenue and 30%+ EBITDA margins within 5 years, with PE exit potential of $300-500M

This model avoids the commoditization trap of pure embedded lending while building multiple defensible advantages through customer ownership, strategic CRM partnerships, and proprietary data assets.

**Core Thesis**: The home services lending market needs a specialized lender that combines the operational efficiency of CRM integration with the strategic advantages of direct customer relationships and data ownership \- not another generic embedded financing widget.

## **1\. Market Analysis & Opportunity**

### **1.1 The Problem We’re Actually Solving**

**For Homeowners:** \- Banks take 1-2 weeks for personal loans, won’t approve small amounts \- Credit cards have 25%+ APR and low limits \- Home equity products are overkill for a $5,000 repair \- Generic lenders don’t understand home services context

**For Contractors:** \- 30-40% of quotes fail due to financing \- Embedded solutions require workflow changes \- Current lenders don’t pay contractors directly (fraud risk) \- No reward for bringing customers

### **1.2 Market Sizing**

•      	**TAM**: $500B+ annual home services spend

•      	**SAM**: $75B in services requiring financing ($2.5K-$25K range)

•      	**SOM**: $5B realistic addressable market in first 5 years

•      	**Target**: 0.5-1% market share \= $250-500M annual originations by year 5

### **1.3 Why Now?**

1\.    	**Rising rates**: Home equity lines less attractive for small repairs

2\.    	**Aging housing stock**: Average US home is 40+ years old

3\.    	**Insurance gaps**: Deductibles rising, coverage declining

4\.    	**Digital adoption**: Contractors and homeowners expect instant decisions

5\.    	**Capital markets**: Growing appetite for specialty consumer loan portfolios

## 

## **3\. Go-to-Market Strategy**

### **3.1 Customer Acquisition Channels**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundation** \- Focus: Southeast region (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina) \- Target: Pest Control, Generator, Lawn Management \- Channels: \- Paid search (Google/Bing) \- 40% of acquisition \- Contractor referrals \- 30% \- Social media (Facebook/NextDoor) \- 20% \- Insurance partner referrals \- 10%

**Phase 2 (Months 7-18): Expansion** \- Expand to Texas, Arizona, Nevada \- Add HVAC, roofing, plumbing emergencies and electrical \- Launch affiliate program with home inspectors \- Partner with 2-3 regional property management companies

**Phase 3 (Months 19-36): Scale** \- National coverage (focus on top 30 metros) \- Launch “SuprFi Preferred Contractor” certification \- Employer partnership channel (employee benefit) \- White-label offering for large contractors

### **3.2 CRM Integration Strategy (Channel, Not Identity)**

**Smart CRM Integration Approach:**

While we’re a direct lender, not an embedded lender, CRM integrations serve as powerful distribution channels that benefit everyone:

**Integration Priority:** 1\. **FieldRoutes** (ServiceTitan subsidiary) \- Pest control focus 2\. **Jobber** \- General home services 3\. **Housecall Pro** \- HVAC/Plumbing focus 4\. **ServiceTitan** \- Enterprise (Year 2+)

**How This Differs from Embedded Lending:** \- **We own the customer relationship** \- customers create SuprFi accounts \- **We control underwriting** \- not dependent on CRM data alone \- **Merchants choose us** \- we’re one option, not trying to be the only option \- **Direct relationship with borrower** \- servicing, collections, repeat loans all through SuprFi

**CRM Integration Features:** \- **One-click financing offer** in quote/invoice workflow \- **Pre-populated application** (customer data from CRM) \- **Real-time status sync** (approved/funded/paid) \- **Automatic reconciliation** (payment matches to invoice) \- **Commission tracking** for merchants

**Why Merchants Will Push SuprFi:** \- **Zero workflow disruption** \- works within their existing system \- **Higher close rates** \- instant approval during quote \- **Automatic reconciliation** \- no manual payment matching \- **Direct contractor payment** \- no chasing customer for money \- **Performance incentives** \- 2-3% referral fee on funded loans

This approach gives us the best of both worlds: the operational efficiency merchants want while maintaining our direct lending model and customer ownership.

### **3.3 Contractor Network Strategy**

**Not a marketplace, but a fulfillment network:**

**Contractor Tiers:** 1\. **Certified Partners** (Top 20%) \- Highest referral rates (3% of loan value) \- Priority customer routing \- Co-marketing opportunities \- Requires: \<2% complaint rate, \<5% default correlation

2\.    	**Verified Network** (Middle 60%)

–     	Standard referral rate (2%)

–     	Listed in customer app 

–     	Basic marketing materials

–     	Requires: License verification, insurance, 2+ completed jobs

3\.    	**Probationary** (Bottom 20%)

–     	Lower referral rate (1%)

–     	Limited customer exposure

–     	Performance improvement required

**Contractor Acquisition:** \- Direct sales to top 500 home service companies \- Self-serve portal for smaller contractors \- Referral bonuses for bringing other contractors

## **6\. Data Strategy \- The Hidden Competitive Advantage**

### **6.1 The Data Moat Thesis**

While we’re building a lending business, our long-term competitive advantage comes from owning the most comprehensive dataset on home services financing behavior. This data becomes increasingly valuable over time and creates multiple monetization opportunities.

### **6.2 Unique Data We’ll Capture**

**Transaction-Level Data:** \- Job type, urgency, seasonality \- Quote-to-close conversion rates by service type \- Actual cost vs. estimated cost \- Time from approval to job completion \- Payment performance by job type

### **6.7 Why This Data Strategy Is Defensible**

1\.    	**Time Advantage**: Every day we collect data competitors don’t have

2\.    	**Unique Access**: CRM integrations \+ direct lending gives us full picture

3\.    	**Network Effects**: More contractors → more data → better products → more contractors

4\.    	**Compound Value**: Historical data becomes more valuable over time

5\.    	**Multiple Moats**: Even if competitors copy model, they lack our data

### **6.8 The Exit Value of Data**

When positioning for exit in years 5-7, our data asset adds significant value:

•      	**For PE Buyers**: Proprietary data supports premium pricing and expansion

•      	**For Strategic Buyers**: Instant competitive advantage in home services

•      	**For Financial Buyers**: De-risked loan portfolio with predictive insights

•      	**Valuation Impact**: Could add 2-3x multiple turns ($50-100M in exit value)

This data strategy transforms SuprFi from just another lender into an intelligence platform that happens to lend money \- a much more valuable and defensible position.

•      	Multiple revenue streams per customer

•      	Clear path to 30%+ EBITDA margins

## **13\. Decision Points & Pivots**

### **13.1 Key Decision Points**

**Month 6**: Evaluate product-market fit \- If approval rates \<20%, adjust underwriting \- If CAC \>$200, pivot acquisition channels \- If contractor adoption \<100, revisit value prop

### **15.2 Go/No-Go Criteria**

**GO if:** \- Can raise $3-5M seed on reasonable terms \- Find forward-flow partner at \<8% cost \- Get 10+ contractors committed to pilot \- Regulatory review shows clear path

**NO-GO if:** \- Seed funding requires \>20% dilution \- Cost of capital exceeds 10% \- Major regulatory barriers discovered \- Contractor interest lukewarm

## **Conclusion**

SuprFi’s direct lending approach represents a more defensible, profitable path than embedded financing. By combining modern technology with traditional lending discipline, we can build a specialty finance company that serves an underserved market while generating attractive returns.

This is not a winner-take-all market, nor does it need to be. By focusing on excellent execution, conservative underwriting, and strong contractor relationships, we can build a $100M+ revenue business that improves home services financing for everyone involved.

The question is not whether this model can work \- companies like OneMain and Mariner prove it can. The question is whether we can execute better than incumbents by leveraging technology and focusing exclusively on home services.
