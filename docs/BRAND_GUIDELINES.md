# SuprFi Brand Guidelines & Design System

**Version 1.0 | November 2025**

---

## 1. Brand Overview

### Brand Essence

SuprFi exists to make financing simple, instant, and accessible. We're building a brand that transcends traditional financial services—approachable enough for the homeowner facing an unexpected repair, trusted enough for the contractor betting their business on us, and modern enough to become the ubiquitous name in consumer lending.

### Brand Promise

**"Financing that works as fast as you need it."**

We promise speed without sacrificing trust. Simplicity without cutting corners. Technology that feels human.

### Brand Positioning Statement

For homeowners facing unexpected expenses, SuprFi is the specialty lender that provides instant, transparent financing directly in their moment of need. Unlike traditional banks that take weeks or credit cards with punishing rates, SuprFi combines the speed of modern fintech with the trust of purpose-built expertise.

### Vision

To become the default answer when anyone needs to finance a major purchase—starting with home services, then expanding to become the most trusted name in consumer lending.

### Mission

To eliminate the friction between needing something and affording it, making fair financing available to everyone in under 60 seconds.

## 2. Brand Personality

### Core Attributes

**Approachable, Not Stuffy**
We're the friend who happens to know about financing, not the banker in a glass office. We speak plainly, avoid jargon, and make people feel comfortable asking questions.

**Modern, Not Cold**
We use technology to make things faster and easier, but never at the expense of warmth. Our digital experience feels human—responsive, helpful, and understanding.

**Trustworthy, Not Boring**
Financial services require trust, but that doesn't mean we have to be dull. We earn trust through transparency, fairness, and delivering on promises—not through conservative design and corporate speak.

**Expert, Not Intimidating**
We know our space deeply, but we share that knowledge to empower rather than impress. We guide people through decisions rather than overwhelming them with options.

**Confident, Not Arrogant**
We believe in what we're building and aren't afraid to say it. But we stay humble about the work ahead and grateful for every customer who trusts us.

### Brand Archetypes

**Primary: The Caregiver**
We exist to help people when they need it most. Our motivation is service, not just profit.

**Secondary: The Sage**
We're the experts in our space, using knowledge and data to make better decisions for our customers.

## 3. Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Brand Voice

Our voice is consistent across all communications—clear, warm, and confident. Think of how a trusted friend who works in finance would explain things: knowledgeable but never condescending, professional but never cold.

### Writing Principles

- **Be Direct:** Say what you mean in as few words as possible. "Apply now" not "Begin your application journey."
- **Be Human:** Use contractions. Say "you" and "we." Write how people actually talk.
- **Be Helpful:** Every piece of content should answer a question or solve a problem.
- **Be Honest:** No fine print games. No hidden fees. No misleading claims.
- **Be Optimistic:** Focus on solutions and possibilities, not problems and limitations.

### Tone Adjustments by Context

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Marketing & Website | Warm, inspiring, confident. We're inviting people into something better. |
| Application Flow | Clear, reassuring, efficient. We're guiding people through an important decision. |
| Support & Help | Patient, understanding, solution-focused. We're helping someone who may be frustrated. |
| Legal & Compliance | Straightforward, complete, transparent. We're being fully honest even when required to be. |
| Contractor Communications | Professional, partner-focused, results-oriented. We're speaking to business owners. |

### Word Choices

**Say This:**
Apply • Approved • Quick • Simple • Fair • Clear • Help • Partner • Instant • Easy

**Not This:**
Submit • Qualified • Fast (overused) • Basic • Cheap • Obvious • Assist • Vendor • Immediate • Effortless

## 6. Logo & Brand Mark

- **Wordmark:** "SuprFi" in Plus Jakarta Sans Bold. The "Fi" is set in a lighter weight or accent color.
- **Combined:** Brandmark + Wordmark is the preferred lockup for most applications.

### Clear Space

Maintain clear space equal to the height of the "r" in SuprFi on all sides of the logo.

### Logo Don'ts

- Don't place on busy backgrounds without sufficient contrast
- Don't separate the brandmark from the wordmark except in favicon/app icon contexts

## 7. Design Principles

### Core Design Philosophy

Our design should make the complex feel simple. Financial services are inherently complicated—our job is to reduce cognitive load at every step while maintaining the trust signals that matter.

### Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Every design decision should make information clearer, not more impressive.
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only what's needed at each moment. Complex information should unfold naturally.
3. **Generous Space:** White space is not empty—it's breathing room. Give elements room to be seen and understood.
4. **Motion with Purpose:** Animation should guide attention and provide feedback, not decorate.
5. **Trust Through Transparency:** Show the work. Progress indicators, clear pricing breakdowns, and visible security signals build trust.

### UI Component Guidelines

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Buttons** | Rounded corners (8px radius), generous padding (12px 24px minimum), clear hierarchy |
| **Cards** | Subtle shadows (0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)), rounded corners (12px), white backgrounds, 24px internal padding |
| **Forms** | Large touch targets (48px minimum height), clear labels above fields, inline validation |
| **Icons** | Outlined style for UI, filled for navigation. Consistent 24px base size. Use Lucide or Heroicons. |

## 8. Photography & Illustration

### Photography Style

- **Subject Matter:** Real people in real homes. Diverse families, homeowners of all ages, authentic service professionals.
- **Lighting:** Natural, warm light. Avoid harsh studio lighting.
- **Composition:** Environmental context matters—show the home, the repair, the relief.
- **Treatment:** Slight warmth in color grading. Avoid over-saturation or heavy filters.

### Illustration Style

- Clean, simple illustrations for concepts that don't photograph well
- Flat design with subtle gradients
- Limited color palette (use brand colors)
- Friendly, rounded shapes
- Avoid: 3D renders, isometric complexity, generic stock illustrations

## 9. Marketing Website Structure

### Site Architecture

The marketing site serves three audiences: homeowners seeking financing, contractors looking to offer financing, and investors/partners.

### Page 1: Homepage

**Hero Section**
- Headline: "Home repairs can't wait. Neither should your financing."
- Subhead: "Get approved in under 60 seconds for the financing you need. No hidden fees. No waiting."
- CTA: "Check your rate" (soft pull, won't affect credit)

**Trust Bar**
Key stats: "60 sec decisions | $2,500-$25,000 | Rates from 14.99% APR | No hard credit check to apply"

**How It Works**
3-step process: (1) Tell us about your project, (2) See your options instantly, (3) Get funded when the work is done

**Why SuprFi**
Key differentiators: instant decisions, fair rates, purpose-built for home services, contractor network

**Social Proof**
Customer testimonials, contractor partner logos, trust badges

## 10. Taglines & Key Messages

### Primary Tagline

**"Financing that works as fast as you need it."**

### Supporting Taglines

- "Your repair. Your terms."
- "60 seconds to yes."
- "Fair rates for real life."
- "The home repair safety net."
- "From quote to done."

### Campaign-Specific Headlines

**For Emergency Repairs:**
- "Your AC doesn't care about your bank account."
- "Pipes burst at the worst times. We're ready anyway."
- "When it breaks, we've got you."

**For Planned Projects:**
- "Finally fix what's been bothering you."
- "Your home improvement timeline, on your terms."
- "Dream it. Finance it. Done."

**For Contractors:**

### Elevator Pitch

"SuprFi is instant financing for home repairs. We help homeowners get approved in under 60 seconds with fair rates and no hidden fees. Contractors love us because we integrate with their systems and pay them directly. We're building the future of how people pay for the things that keep their homes running."

---

## 11. Brand Evolution & Future Positioning

### Building for Ubiquity

The SuprFi brand is intentionally designed to grow beyond home services. The name ("Super Finance") is category-agnostic, and our visual identity is built on principles that translate across verticals.

### Phase 1: Home Services Specialist (Current)

Establish brand recognition as the go-to for home repair financing. The home brandmark is appropriate and reinforces specialization.

### Phase 2: Home Services Leader

Expand to adjacent categories (auto repair, medical, education). Begin transitioning from the home-specific brandmark to a more abstract "S" mark.

### Phase 3: Consumer Finance Platform

Position as a general-purpose financing platform. The brand should feel like "the Klarna/Affirm of everything else."

### The Long-Term Vision

SuprFi should become what Square became for payments—the obvious, trusted answer for a previously fragmented and frustrating experience.
